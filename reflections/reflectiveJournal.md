## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a Visual programming mainly aim at student age 6 to 16. It is uses blocks of command to "make" the program.
### What is visual programming?
Visual Programmming (VP), means the programming language uses blocks of command that can be joined to form a program. Uses of scratch may include simple games, story telling using visual images. 
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
I have discovered are ,Simplicity, not to repeat oneself, code is for now not future,simple codes, do not optimize prematurely.
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
I have made a scratch project paste to canvas.
## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.Git  is basically a content tracker. By that it means that git is a plce where all programmer can woprk on a program simultaneously and git will track and trace the changes with it program. Take note it is not a a coding program.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub however is a cloud base hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

### What is Phyton?
Phyton is a coding language that is widely use these days among software developers.
The reason that it is popular is that it is easy to understand and the transition from software designer and developer from other coding language is made much easier with the easy to understand and simple language uses. Writing in phyton is more like writing and a "sentence"  in english. 

Usually a new user would understand the language in the first 15 minutes of learning the phyton language.

### Phyton For Myself
However, it is not that everyone can be like duck to water in using phyton language for writing their code and program. I for one cannot fathom how it works even after numerous attempts of trying to make sense of the code language. The simplest of print a word is all good but beyond that is still very high hurdle to go over for me.

Be that as it may I am still trying to learn the language albeit at a much more slower pace than others. Hopefully by the end of this course I may write some code.

### Sofware Development as an Art?

It is an Art for the ones who get it. to the people at large it is gibberish language even alien.


MY PSEUDO CODE

"""
I would like to calculate how much gold is needed to plate a certain surface area.

"""
"so here it goes"
Please choose the shape of your parts "square or round"
 
print x (input the length of the parts)
print y (input the width of the parts)
print z (input the height of the parts)

elif square
calculate square = 2(x + y + z)

Print square
